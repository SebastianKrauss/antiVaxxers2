            <p>Alexandra Hall has spent two decades working in science communication, business, and education. While primarily focused on space exploration and astronomy, Alex is passionate about improving science literacy and critical thinking – skills she considers essential to participate fully in today’s society.  As a science center CEO, author, and former TV host, Alex hasn’t shied away from engaging with creationists, ufologists, astrologers, and other pseudo/anti science practitioners.</p>
            <div id="hallMore" class="collapse out">
                <p>I was still trying to come to terms with how things had played out. In the space of just over a week I’d gone from winding down my work so I could go on maternity leave before experiencing what I hoped would be a natural hospital birth to holding a teeny preemie who had just been discharged from the NICU. One moment I was sending emails, the next I was being pumped full of drugs to keep me stable while my baby was born by emergency c-section. After six years of infertility struggles and five rounds of IVF, this was a very, very wanted child and I don’t like to think about how close we might have been to tragedy.
                Perhaps it was the lack of sleep. Perhaps it was the postpartum hormones. </p> <p>Perhaps it was the pressure that comes when you’re struggling to breastfeed. Perhaps it was my body recovering from the surgical and medical trauma. I do know I was grappling with guilt that my placenta had been so inadequate that my son’s fetal growth had been restricted. Whatever it was, all I knew was that I felt completely unable to handle what was ahead. I’d had no time to grieve or even process that had just happened. I was suffering from a huge black gnawing mass of doubt, anxiety and worry.
                This may be why, then, as I sat across from my pediatrician, holding my four-pound newborn son, that I said: “But he’s so tiny, shouldn’t we delay the vaccines?”</p>
                <p>To understand how out of character such a question is for me, you should know that most of my career has been involved with science communication and education, primarily in the areas of space and astronomy. I value critical thinking. I respect how people have become experts in their fields. After all, I had trusted doctors to help me conceive my son. During childbirth, I had trusted doctors with both my life and my son’s. It did not compute that I would question the vaccine schedule. But yet, I did.
                The pediatrician raised her eyebrows. She had been practicing for decades and instantly decided that I was the kind of fool she did not want to suffer. She turned around, pulled a sheaf of leaflets from a wall pocket, and handed them to me. “Read these” she said, “and afterwards I’ll answer any questions you might have.”</p>
                <p>I took the leaflets, dumbfounded that I had even uttered my question, and I think I mumbled something about seeing her at the next check up and left as quickly as I could. I’m sure my cheeks were burning.
                I was so mortified that I immediately registered with a different pediatrician, one who didn’t know that I was, even for just a tiny moment in time, a vaccine-hesitant parent.   My son got all his shots on schedule and is a thriving toddler today. I was too hard on myself. These questions are perfectly normal, especially in a culture in which anti-vaccine rhetoric has created a culture of fear around vaccines.</p>
                <p>I can now say to vaccine-hesitant parents, hey, I know exactly what that fear and doubt feels like. I know how overpowering the impulse to protect your child can feel, because for one moment my emotional instinct overrode all my years of critical thinking and the reading I had done ahead of the birth, and made me believe that my preemie son was too little, and too vulnerable, for “all those shots.”
                But I’m not an immunologist or a pediatrician, and I’m not bold enough to believe that my maternal instinct trumps decades of peer-reviewed research and studies worldwide. Nor am I someone who would knowingly put children more vulnerable than my little guy – such as those I had seen fighting for their lives in the NICU – at risk by not vaccinating my child or myself.</p>

                <p>I’m writing this from quarantine, the irony of which isn’t lost on me. Emotionally, I’m a bit raw. Mentally, a bit taxed. Physically, I’m fine.  All seven of my unvaccinated children have whooping cough, and the kicker is that they may have given it to my five-month-old niece, too young to be fully vaccinated.
                We’d had a games night at our house in March, and my brother-in-law had a full-blown cold, so when the kids started with a dry cough a few days later I didn’t think much of it.  But a week after the symptoms started the kids weren’t improving—in fact they were getting worse.
                And the cough. No one had a runny nose or sneezing but they all had the same unproductive cough. Between coughing fits they were fine.
                Then a few days later, at midnight, I snapped. My youngest three children were coughing so hard they would gag or vomit. I’d never seen anything like this before.  Watching our youngest struggle with this choking cough, bringing up clear, stringy mucus – I knew I had heard of this before somewhere.  My mom said I had it when I was a kid. I snapped into “something is WRONG” mode.
                I jumped on Google to type in “child cough.” My kids had all but one symptom of pertussis—none of them had the characteristic “whoop.” But they had everything else. We had vaccinated our first three children on a delayed schedule and our youngest four weren’t vaccinated at all.  We stopped because we were scared and didn’t know who to trust.  Was the medical community just paid-off puppets of a Big Pharma-Government-Media conspiracy?  Were these vaccines even necessary in this day and age? Were we unwittingly doing greater harm than help to our beloved children? So much smoke must mean a fire, we thought, so we defaulted to the “do nothing and hope nothing bad happens” position.</p>
                <p>For years relatives tried to persuade us to reconsider, but this only irritated us and made us defensive.  Secretly, I hoped I would find the proof I needed to hold the course, but deep down I was resigned to only find endless conflicting arguments that never resolved anything.  No matter if we vaccinated or not, I thought, it would be nothing more than a coin toss with horrible risks either way.
                When the Disneyland measles outbreak happened my husband and I agreed to take a new look and weigh the evidence on both sides. A friend suggested I write out my questions so we could tackle them one by one.  Just getting it out on paper helped so much. I only ended up with a handful of questions. But more potent than my questions were my biases. I just didn’t trust civic government, the medical community, the pharmaceutical industry, and people in general. By default, I had excluded all research available from any major, reputable organization.  Could all the in-house, independent, peer-reviewed clinical trials, research papers and studies across the globe ALL be flawed, corrupt and untrustworthy?</p>
                <p>The final shift came when I connected the dots between a small, but real measles outbreak in my personal circles this time last year.  But for the grace of God, our family was one step from contracting measles in our mostly under-or-unvaccinated 7 kids.  Maybe we could have weathered that storm unscathed in personal quarantine. But in the 4 highly contagious days before any symptoms show we easily could have passed on our infection to my sister’s toddlers or her 34-week-old son in the NICU.
                When I connected the dates for everyone involved in that outbreak it chilled me to the bone.  I looked again at the science and evidence for community immunity and found myself gripped with a very real sense of personal and social responsibility before God and man.  The time had come to make a more fully informed decision than we did 6 years ago.  I sat down with our family doctor and we put together a catch-up vaccination schedule for our children.
                That schedule that was supposed to start the week after I found myself in the waiting room of the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) with my 10-month-old son, waiting to confirm if he had whooping cough.</p>
                <p>I said before that the irony isn’t lost on me that I’m writing this from quarantine.  For six years we were frozen in fear from vaccines, and now we are frozen because of the disease.  My oldest two are getting better, the youngest four are getting worse and fast.  Ottawa Public Health has been so helpful and communicative, trying to get us the help we need while keeping the community safe.  We are under quarantine and starting antibiotics.  Tonight, the baby started “whooping.”  I did the right thing going to the hospital when I did.  I can only hope this painfully honest sharing will help others.
                I am not looking forward to any gloating or shame as this “defection” from the antivaxx camp goes public, but, this isn’t a popularity contest.  Right now my family is living the consequences of misinformation and fear.  I understand that families in our community may be mad at us for putting their kids at risk.  I want them to know that we tried our best to protect our kids when we were afraid of vaccination and we are doing our best now, for everyone’s sake, by getting them up to date.  We can’t take it back … but we can learn from this and help others the same way we have been helped.
                Vaccination is a serious decision about our personal and public health that can’t be made out of fear, capitulation, or by following any crowd.  No one was more surprised than us to find solid answers that actually laid our fears to rest.  I am confident that anyone with questions can find answers.  I would only advise them to check your biases, sources and calendar: Time waits for no parent.</p>

            <p>Ashley Phillips is a wife and mother of four children. She is a stay-at-home Mom who has a Bachelor of Science degree in Dental Hygiene.  She and her husband have been married 15 years.</p>
            <div id="phillipsMore" class="collapse out">
                <p>I am a parent who did not vaccinate my children when they were young.  I delivered my four children at home.  I have the strongest, healthiest, most beautiful babies.  My third-born son, Jacob, was born smaller than the other three children. I did not think anything of it because I felt he would catch up.  I ate very healthy while I was pregnant with him, as I did with my other three.  There were no toxins or trauma that surrounded him the day he was born.  His birth was beautiful.  And I did everything right, as far as keeping him and my other children safe from everything that would cause autism—or what I thought would cause autism.
                I noticed Jacob was behind in some of his milestones. Although he didn’t walk until eighteen months, he reached his cognitive milestones.  He was a very happy baby. I assumed he was a late walker because he was small, but I found myself regularly taking him to the doctor to find out if Jacob was okay; because he was hitting his other milestones, he was fine.  I did keep a diligent eye on him, however.
                As the months went on, Jacob stopped hitting those cognitive milestones. Because we had recently moved, we saw a new doctor. This doctor, too, tried to tell me Jacob was just fine. After all, he was so cute and happy. However, I just knew something was not right. I took him to an eye doctor to get his eyes checked because he wasn’t getting his colors.  I had been reading to him and teaching him his colors, and he wasn’t getting it. I thought maybe he was colorblind.  His eyes checked out okay.  I went to get his hearing checked and his hearing was okay as well.</p>
                <p>Finally, I took Jacob to get tested by the local school district, an early childhood screening.  After they tested him, they told me that he was “severely delayed” and had autistic tendencies. I am sure you can imagine my absolute shock and complete heartache. I could not blame vaccines, and I could not blame toxins. All I could do was move forward. The district recommended early interventions in preschool for Jacob.
                I was upset about my son’s autism because I thought I did everything right. I am so healthy. My husband is healthy. My other children are healthy.  I had been told by several of my other son’s teachers that he is the smartest student they have ever taught. My daughter, without even trying, is a very talented swimmer.  I tell you this because I want you to know that I know there is nothing I did as a mother to “cause” my Jacob’s autism.  There is no pattern whatsoever in my children to indicate I did anything to cause this to happen to my Jacob.  There are voices out there that say toxins and vaccines cause autism.  I know that is not the case.</p>
                <p>After I learned that Jacob had autism, I vaccinated him. However, because we were so behind in the schedule, I had to file an exemption before preschool just to give me time to catch him up. I also began to vaccinate my other children before they entered public school, but as with Jacob, we were so behind that we still had to file exemptions. None of my children had reactions after their vaccinations—my oldest son is still very smart, my daughter is still very talented, and my son Jacob is still very happy. As a side note, my youngest daughter had been fussy for many years in her early life. I found out later that she is allergic to wheat.  As soon as I took her off of wheat, she had improved with every aspect in her life, When she eats wheat, she feels and acts terrible.  She is very sensitive andnd she had no reaction whatsoever to the MMR vaccine or any other vaccine.
                My son Jacob was born as God intended him to be born.  He was conceived and born in his own special and perfect package.  I thank God that my children are now safe from vaccine-preventable diseases.  I believe it was divine intervention that kept them safe until they were able to be vaccinated.  I know now that vaccines are safe for my family.</p>

            <p>Juniper Russo is a freelance writer and mom of two living in Chattanooga, TN. She is a vocal advocate for science and evidence-based parenting. You can find her at juniperwrites.com.</p>
            <div id="russoMore" class="collapse out">
                <p>“It’s fun to watch you both grow up,” the doctor said, putting a Band-Aid over the site where my three-year-old daughter had just received the MMR vaccine. At first, I bristled at her condescension, at the idea that I somehow still had growing up to do. But it was true. When I’d first visited her office three years before, I had been a different person. I had been a child.
                My fears were a product of a potentially lethal combination of maternal panic and youthful ignorance. I was afraid. I was afraid of autism, of chemicals, of pharmaceutical companies, of pills, of needles. I saw medicine as an impersonal monolith of unpronounceable words and latex gloves, of figures and averages and data. I didn’t trust it with the pearl I guarded inside my womb. I wanted my baby to be safe—and safety, it seemed, could be promised by midwives and crystals, herbs and exercises. I didn’t trust science to provide it.
                So, from the moment my daughter was conceived in my then-twenty-year-old womb, I battled the imaginary foe called Medicine with all my strength. I avoided anything but organic, whole foods, imagining that a baby knitted together with carrot juice and quinoa would be guaranteed a healthy life. Corn syrup and microwave meals were off the menu, along with tuna and deli meat. When I started receiving prenatal care, I vehemently asserted that I wanted to avoid any and all “interventions” that could hurt my baby.</p>
                <p>No medically unnecessary ultrasounds, I wrote.</p>
                <p>No medications without my explicit consent.</p>
                <p>No induction, period.</p>
                <p>No epidural. No Demerol. I don’t want pain relief of any kind during or after labor.</p>
                <p>No Pitocin unless I’m bleeding to death.</p>
                <p>I will breastfeed immediately after the baby’s birth.
                When my obstetrician suggested that I might benefit from a low-dose medication to help my anxiety, I balled up my fists and gritted my teeth. Who was this bully, trying to shove Big Pharma down my throat? Why was she so hell-bent on poisoning my baby? My baby had to be a natural baby. I didn’t want her to end up like Other People’s Kids, the ones who eat fast food and watch TV. She was going to be perfect. She was going to be healthy.
                So, when the day rolled around that I brought my homegrown organic baby to the pediatrician’s office for the first time, it was predictable enough that I scribbled onto her intake forms, “NO VACCINES.” They caused autism. I knew they did. That’s what I heard constantly from the blogs and the mommy groups and the parenting forums. The vaccines were loaded with mercury and aluminum. They caused brain damage. I knew better than to give my baby poison.
                Today, I understand that I might owe my children’s lives to the pediatrician’s fed-up, no-nonsense attitude.
                “Great,” she said, pushing her silver hair behind her ear, “So you think you know better than me. Can you tell me, Ms. Russo, where you went to medical school?”
                I started to tell her about how the curriculum of medical school was funded by the pharmaceutical industry—that’s what I had read, anyway—but I stopped myself.</p>
                <p>“You’re a lucky kid, you know that?” she said.
                “I’m not a kid. I’ll be twenty-one tomorrow,” I objected. She rolled her eyes.
                “You’ll be twenty-one, and that means you grew up with the Internet, and you’re a smart girl, and you’ve had access to a lot of information, and you don’t know how to tell the good from the bad. That’s not what makes you lucky. What makes you lucky is that you didn’t grow up seeing kids get paralyzed by polio. I did. You’ve never watched an unvaccinated baby slowly choke to death on its own snot from whooping cough. I have. You’ve never seen the grief of parents who could have prevented their kids from getting sick but chose to trust Jenny McCarthy instead of me. I have… So, tell me, in your words, why it is that you think you shouldn’t vaccinate your baby.” “I… It’s just too many of them, too soon. And there’s got to be a reason that rates of autism are skyrocketing. That doesn’t just happen out of nowhere.”
                “Does it not? Because I can tell you right now that if your baby is going to be autistic, she’s going to be autistic whether you vaccinate her or not. The only difference between now and fifty years ago is that kids with autism are diagnosed correctly now. They used to be called ‘mentally retarded’ if they couldn’t speak, but that diagnosis is rare now. If you looked, you’d know that rates of nonverbal autism are going up at the same speed that rates of “Mental Retardation” are going down. And autistic kids who can speak weren’t considered to have a disease until recently. They were called eccentric, or gifted. They were musicians and writers. There is no autism epidemic.”
                “But it’s just too many shots when they’re so young.”
                “Says who? The CDC? The American Academy of Pediatrics? The World Health Organization? One thing that they’ve done that you haven’t done is actually study what happens when we give babies shots. The schedule is made by a lot of thoughtful, intelligent people who have looked very carefully at the benefits and the risks, and they found out over years—decades—of research that babies are safest and healthiest being vaccinated on the current schedule. If you’ve got any research to show me otherwise, then please do.”
                “Dr. Sears—“
                “Isn’t very smart and is jeopardizing kids’ lives so he can make a profit selling a bad book. I don’t make a profit giving vaccines, but he makes a profit telling you to be scared of them. Which one of us do you want to think is the big medical bogeyman? And you can tell him I said that, should you ever meet him.”
                (Years later, I would end up encountering Bill and Bob Sears many times over the course of my career, interviewing them sporadically. Somehow, I’ve never managed to include, “By the way, my daughter’s first pediatrician hates you,” in any of my emails to them.)</p>
                <p>She handed me packets of information about vaccines and told me to go home and read “actual material by actual experts.” I was unsure whether to be angry or confused or relieved. When I told an online attachment parenting group about the experience, the crowd erupted in anger—more over the fact that someone would insult Dr. Sears than anything else.
                Still, I suppose in trying to make a point, I returned to the same office for all of our well-visits, not budging on my anti-vaccine stance. At my daughter’s four-month checkup, the pediatrician said, “I’m going to give you a referral to Early Intervention. This baby has some developmental delays. She’s going to be okay, but you’ll need to get in touch with them.”
                She showed me how my daughter’s muscles weren’t responding as they should, and that her gross motor development was lagging behind average. I waited for her to lecture me about how important it was for me to get vaccines, but she waved the worries aside at the moment, adding, “I don’t want you to blame me or a vaccine for your baby’s delays.”
                I spent weeks crying over the idea that something was wrong with my baby. It wasn’t supposed to happen to me. I was doing everything right, and developmental delays were supposed to happen to other people’s children. I felt horrified and out of place when I went to the physical therapy office to try to boost my daughter’s development. The other children there had something wrong with them. What did I do to put my child in the same category? As the years went by, things changed in my heart and in my mind. It was clear that my daughter wasn’t developing normally. She was clumsy and awkward in her movements. She couldn’t walk until 16 months and wasn’t learning to talk the way other kids were. Something was off.
                I mentioned at her one-year checkup that her speech development was unusual.
                “She can say ‘manatee’ and point to a picture of a manatee in a book, but she doesn’t say ‘no’ or ‘bye-bye,’” I said plaintively.
                At eighteen months: “She’s speaking in sentences, but it’s just repeating things she’s heard somewhere else.”
                At twenty-four months: “She can read short words and she recites whole books from memory, but I can’t get her to answer a question.”
                At two and a half years: “Doctor, I’ve been doing a lot of research and I know what these symptoms are now. The echolalia, the pronoun reversal, the gross motor delays. I’m pretty sure she has autism.”</p>
                <p>The pediatrician twisted her face, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and said, “We’ll see.”
                She referred me to a neurologist and a speech therapist. Both said at my daughter had signs of so-called high-function autism, but warned that it was too soon to diagnose it.
                As time had gone by, I’d ended up consenting to vaccines here and there—“just the most important ones,” I’d said— because little by little, the doctor’s words had started to make sense. I couldn’t deny that my daughter had developmental delays well before she was ever vaccinated. I also couldn’t argue against an increasingly large stack of evidence confirming that vaccines were safe and effective.
                I started to understand science. How the peer review process works. The difference between a study and a systematic review. How you can tell a good study from a bad one. How groups like the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics form consensus statements. How easy it is for people peddling pseudoscience to pass themselves off as experts. How often a parent, struck by grief, will look for a reason to blame an outside force when her child doesn’t turn out the way she expected.
                By the time my daughter was three, I could no longer deny three things: she was developmentally different, she needed to be vaccinated, and vaccines had nothing to do with her differences. At her three-year checkup, she became completely “caught up” on all of her vaccines, including the dreaded MMR shot, which I had phobically postponed for as long as I could justify.
                She cried a little when she got the vaccines. She had a slight fever after a few of them. But, ultimately, her reactions were mild and unremarkable. She felt fine. She looked fine. And, although she continued developing unusually, she never had any developmental regressions that coincided with immunizations. They had nothing at all to do with her autism symptoms.
                I’m now the mother of a beautiful, brilliant, eccentric six-year-old who is both vaccinated and autistic. She’s clumsy and awkward and a social disaster. Other kids don’t understand the complex sentences and grown-up words she uses. She tends to have meltdowns at the worst possible times, flapping her arms and making high-pitched noises. She has trouble understanding boundaries and social norms. Her motor skills are still on par with a three- or four-year-old.</p>
                <p>And there are wonderful things, as well—things that make me proud. She reads on a fourth-grade level and writes amazing stories. Her greatest passions in life are kittens, fuzzy blankets, and her baby brother. She dreams of opening a cat rescue when she grows up and hopes that her cat, Happy, will live long enough to be a permanent resident and ambassador. She insists that Happy must be autistic like her, because he shares her love of fuzzy blankets “and because he’s weird.” I feel proud of my autistic daughter every day.
                It’s funny, but it’s turned out that autism, the thing I feared most, became one of the most wonderful and important things in my life. It’s not a curse. It’s not even a disease. It’s a neurological difference that makes my daughter unique and makes me proud to be her mother. Even if I could have somehow prevented it, I wouldn’t have, because I genuinely love my child exactly the way she is.
                My son is two weeks old and was born to a completely different person than my daughter was born to. I’ve grown up. I’m not afraid of ultrasounds or medicine. I took medication when I was pregnant with him and I even enjoyed an occasional soda. I smiled when I got vaccinated for flu and whooping cough during pregnancy. When my blood pressure skyrocketed during labor, I didn’t hesitate to accept medication to protect him. And, when his two-month checkup rolls around, I will be glad that he will have the protection afforded by his first vaccines. I want my son to be safe and well, and I’ve learned over the course of the last seven years that vaccines are miracles of modern medicine that help to guarantee that my kids will lead long and healthy lives. If my son turns out to be autistic like his older sister, I will love him just as deeply and completely.
                I will not blame the miracle of medicine for the fact that my children are beautifully and wonderfully unique.</p>

            <h3>Danielle Stringer</h3>
            <img src="images/stories/stinger.png" class="storyImage">
            <p>Danielle Stringer, CPNP is a pediatric nurse practitioner in Chandler, Arizona. She became the youngest nurse practitioner in the United States after graduating with her master’s degree in nursing at age 18. Now at age 22, when she isn’t seeing lots of little patients in the office, she spends her time blogging at www.kidnurse.org with the goal of bringing public awareness to child’s health.</p>
            <div id="stingerMore" class="collapse out" class"moreDiv">
                <p>As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I have given thousands of vaccines to children. But most people don’t know something very important about me. I have a history with vaccinations that I have kept quiet for a long time.
                I was anti-vaccinations
                I am the first born of four children to wonderful parents. My mom and dad would go to the moon and back for any of us kids, and many of their selfless actions continue to amaze me today. My mom is an educator, and a very good one at that. She can make a research topic out of anything. I remember while planning my wedding, my mom researched for days the exact style and order of every single word on my wedding invitations, even finding historical invitations from different time periods to serve as guides.
                So, in 1992, when I was born, it’s not surprising that she did her homework when it came to vaccinating me. After researching, she decided to vaccinate me based off of what she found and her pediatrician’s recommendations. Then she vaccinated my little sister. After all, my parents both still have a small scar on their arm from the smallpox vaccination they received as children, serving as a reminder of the fight against the disease that ravaged mankind for a millennium. Even as recently as the decade they were born, the 1960’s, smallpox killed as many as 2 million a year.
                But as these life-threatening diseases began to slowly fade away, the accusations against vaccines started flowing out of the media and the Internet. Immunizations cause autism. Immunizations aren’t effective. They contain mercury that could ruin your child’s brain. Maybe children will be allergic to them. They will overload the immune system. Isn’t natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity anyway? The vaccination schedule is a get-rich-fast scheme for physicians and pharmaceutical companies. I have heard them all.</p>
                <p>With the growing voice of the anti-vaccination movement, my mom, with her master’s degree in education, heard them too. The allegations against vaccinations could make any parent cautious. As a result, her third daughter received very few vaccinations, and by the time my brother was born, he received almost none at all. As like-minded people tend to congregate, we were surrounded by friends and family that chose not to vaccinate as well. These parents, like my own, loved their kids so much that they would have died for them in a minute. With the increasing fears about vaccines, they absolutely believed they were doing the safest thing for their children.
                Fast forward to my college days when I decided to become a nurse practitioner, and a pediatric nurse practitioner at that. I remember discussing with my mom that the only down-side to my specialty would be giving vaccinations to children. She told me that I would figure that out later, and just to let parents pick out the vaccines that they wanted.
                In coming up with topics for my thesis, I wanted to study the adverse effects of vaccinations and all the children suffering from them. I wanted to study the link between immunizations and autism; look into all the shattered immune systems from combination vaccines. I wanted to learn more about what I had heard from my community for so long, and represent their opinions in the scientific community.</p>
                <p>And that’s when I started to change my mind.
                There was nothing to base a thesis on. The evidence just wasn’t there. Not only was there to no evidence that vaccines caused autism or overwhelmed the immune system but in fact, vaccines are incredibly safe and effective and protect children when they are most vulnerable.
                Maybe vaccinations weren’t so bad after all.
                Over the course of my education, I went on to care for a one-month-old fighting for her life against pertussis . She had been too young to be vaccinated. Her horrific cough and the sight of her helpless parents will stay with me forever.
                I learned from a case study that a child born in my county died because her mom had developed chickenpox a few days before delivery. I was alerted by the health department when measles was found in my area. My own great uncle is in a wheelchair to this day from a childhood case of polio. I studied a child whose legs and arms were amputated after meningitis nearly cost him his life. I watched a toddler almost die from dehydration due to rotavirus. I’ve cared for many children with cancer and immunodeficiencies whom I worry about due to daily declining herd immunity.
                But most of all, I learned that this suffering is preventable.
                So I graduated, and now I give vaccines. I started with my siblings, my family, and my friends. Over time, I have given thousands and thousands of vaccines, and I think it is one of the most important accomplishments of my career. I can scientifically rebut the arguments against vaccinations that I heard as a child, and I do so on a daily basis. In fact, I can’t wait to provide and discuss the science behind vaccines in more depth on my blog.</p>
                <p>But at the end of the day, I don’t try to convince anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant parents to immunize their children because I am raking in money or because I am a public health Nazi, as I have been accused of. Rather, I work to convince them because I truly care. I have walked in their shoes, read their articles, and even believed their philosophies for a portion of my life.
                I worry for the anti-vaccination community that I grew up in. With most of these highly contagious diseases, like measles, capable of infecting 80-90% of the unvaccinated children and adults who come in contact with them, epidemics are not far away. In fact, California declared a pertussis epidemic in June and has reported more than 5,393 number of cases just this year. These diseases are lurking in our neighborhoods, and I have to speak out. I love what Jeffrey Kluger wrote in TIME magazine, “Vaccines save lives; fear endangers them.” I want my friends in the anti-vaccination community to not be afraid, and as someone who knows them well, I want to continue sharing my story, my personal experiences, and the science to help eliminate fears about vaccines and to help them protect their children.</p>
