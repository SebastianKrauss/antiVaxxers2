                    Immunization is one of the most successful public health achievements of the 20th Century. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that, among children born between 1994 and 2013, vaccination will prevent about 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes. This will net a savings of $295 billion in direct costs and $1.4 trillion in total societal costs. Annually, two to three million lives are saved worldwide due to vaccinations, a number that could double with increased support and funding.

                <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
Vaccines have eradicated smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases known to mankind from the face of the earth. Efforts to eradicate polio, a highly infectious disease that invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours, have been so successful that only a handful of countries continue to report cases.
                </p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Worldwide eradication of polio by 2018 is a top priority of global health leaders, including ECBT.
Vaccine programs continue to be underfunded by Congress, despite their enormous cost savings. Please join ECBT and our 317 Coalition to learn more about how to contact members of Congress to request funding for vaccines programs in the U.S. and join ECBT's partners at Shot@Life.org to demand the same for children in developing nations.

                    Concerned citizens have questioned the use of and the safety of vaccines since the advent of the first vaccine against smallpox back in 1796 by Edward Jenner. Political cartoons of the era reflect concerns that people who received the cow pox inoculation would grow horns, tails and other attributes of cows.

                    In recent years vaccines have been targeted as the cause of the increase in autism rates throughout the world. Hypothesis were generated suggesting that either combined Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine or the ingredient thimerosal, found in some vaccines could be the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                    Fortunately, the worldwide scientific community, the U.S. government and partner agencies take such accusations very seriously, investigating potential vaccine safety issues in great depth by conducting rigorous studies to determine the feasibility of harm. ECBT's Vaccinate Your Baby website provides details on peer-reviewed articles and studies by medical experts who adhere to rigorous scientific standards when researching possible connections between vaccines and long term ailments.
